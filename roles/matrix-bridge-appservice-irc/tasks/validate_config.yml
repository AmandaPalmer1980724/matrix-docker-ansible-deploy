# Our base configuration (`matrix_appservice_irc_configuration_yaml`) is not enough to
# let the playbook run without errors.
#
# Unless the final configuration (`matrix_appservice_irc_configuration`) contains an `ircService` definition,
# we'd fail generating the registration.yaml file with a non-helpful error.
#
# This is a safety check to ensure we fail earlier and in a nicer way.

    msg: >-
      Your Appservice IRC configuration is incomplete (lacking an `ircService` key).
      You need to define additional configuration in `matrix_appservice_irc_configuration_extension_yaml` or to override `matrix_appservice_irc_configuration`.
