# A Synapse generic worker can handle both federation and client-server API endpoints.
# We wish to split these, as we normally serve federation separately and don't want them mixed up.
#

  # Note that a [HTTP listener](usage/configuration/config_documentation.md#listeners)
  # with `client` and `federation` `resources` must be configured in the `worker_listeners`
  # option in the worker config.

  # #### Load balancing

  # It is possible to run multiple instances of this worker app, with incoming requests
  # being load-balanced between them by the reverse-proxy. However, different endpoints
  # have different characteristics and so admins
  # may wish to run multiple groups of workers handling different endpoints so that
  # load balancing can be done in different ways.

  # For `/sync` and `/initialSync` requests it will be more efficient if all
  # requests from a particular user are routed to a single instance. Extracting a
  # user ID from the access token or `Authorization` header is currently left as an
  # exercise for the reader. Admins may additionally wish to separate out `/sync`
  # requests that have a `since` query parameter from those that don't (and
  # `/initialSync`), as requests that don't are known as "initial sync" that happens
  # when a user logs in on a new device and can be *very* resource intensive, so
  # isolating these requests will stop them from interfering with other users ongoing
  # syncs.

  # Federation and client requests can be balanced via simple round robin.

  # The inbound federation transaction request `^/_matrix/federation/v1/send/`
  # should be balanced by source IP so that transactions from the same remote server
  # go to the same process.

  # Registration/login requests can be handled separately purely to help ensure that
  # unexpected load doesn't affect new logins and sign ups.

  # Finally, event sending requests can be balanced by the room ID in the URI (or
  # the full URI, or even just round robin), the room ID is the path component after
  # `/rooms/`. If there is a large bridge connected that is sending or may send lots
  # of events, then a dedicated set of workers can be provisioned to limit the
  # effects of bursts of events from that bridge on events sent by normal users.

  # #### Stream writers

  # Additionally, the writing of specific streams (such as events) can be moved off
  # of the main process to a particular worker.

  # To enable this, the worker must have a
  # [HTTP `replication` listener](usage/configuration/config_documentation.md#listeners) configured,
  # have a `worker_name` and be listed in the `instance_map` config. The same worker
  # can handle multiple streams, but unless otherwise documented, each stream can only
  # have a single writer.

  # For example, to move event persistence off to a dedicated worker, the shared
  # configuration would include:

  # ```yaml
  # instance_map:
  #     event_persister1:
  #         host: localhost
  #         port: 8034

  # stream_writers:
  #     events: event_persister1
  # ```

  # An example for a stream writer instance:

  # ```yaml
  # {{#include systemd-with-workers/workers/event_persister.yaml}}
  # ```

  # Some of the streams have associated endpoints which, for maximum efficiency, should
  # be routed to the workers handling that stream. See below for the currently supported
  # streams and the endpoints associated with them:

  # ##### The `events` stream

  # The `events` stream experimentally supports having multiple writers, where work
  # is sharded between them by room ID. Note that you *must* restart all worker
  # instances when adding or removing event persisters. An example `stream_writers`
  # configuration with multiple writers:

  # ```yaml
  # stream_writers:
  #     events:
  #         - event_persister1
  #         - event_persister2
  # ```

  # ##### The `typing` stream

  # The following endpoints should be routed directly to the worker configured as
  # the stream writer for the `typing` stream:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|v3|unstable)/rooms/.*/typing

  # ##### The `to_device` stream

  # The following endpoints should be routed directly to the worker configured as
  # the stream writer for the `to_device` stream:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/sendToDevice/

  # ##### The `account_data` stream

  # The following endpoints should be routed directly to the worker configured as
  # the stream writer for the `account_data` stream:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/.*/tags
  # ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/.*/account_data

  # ##### The `receipts` stream

  # The following endpoints should be routed directly to the worker configured as
  # the stream writer for the `receipts` stream:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/rooms/.*/receipt
  # ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/rooms/.*/read_markers

  # ##### The `presence` stream

  # The following endpoints should be routed directly to the worker configured as
  # the stream writer for the `presence` stream:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|v3|unstable)/presence/

  # #### Background tasks

  # There is also support for moving background tasks to a separate
  # worker. Background tasks are run periodically or started via replication. Exactly
  # which tasks are configured to run depends on your Synapse configuration (e.g. if
  # stats is enabled). This worker doesn't handle any REST endpoints itself.

  # To enable this, the worker must have a `worker_name` and can be configured to run
  # background tasks. For example, to move background tasks to a dedicated worker,
  # the shared configuration would include:

  # ```yaml
  # run_background_tasks_on: background_worker
  # ```

  # You might also wish to investigate the `update_user_directory_from_worker` and
  # `media_instance_running_background_jobs` settings.

  # An example for a dedicated background worker instance:

  # ```yaml
  # {{#include systemd-with-workers/workers/background_worker.yaml}}
  # ```

  # #### Updating the User Directory

  # You can designate one generic worker to update the user directory.

  # Specify its name in the shared configuration as follows:

  # ```yaml
  # update_user_directory_from_worker: worker_name
  # ```

  # This work cannot be load-balanced; please ensure the main process is restarted
  # after setting this option in the shared configuration!

  # User directory updates allow REST endpoints matching the following regular
  # expressions to work:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/user_directory/search$

  # The above endpoints can be routed to any worker, though you may choose to route
  # it to the chosen user directory worker.

  # This style of configuration supersedes the legacy `synapse.app.user_dir`
  # worker application type.


  # #### Notifying Application Services

  # You can designate one generic worker to send output traffic to Application Services.
  # Doesn't handle any REST endpoints itself, but you should specify its name in the
  # shared configuration as follows:

  # ```yaml
  # notify_appservices_from_worker: worker_name
  # ```

  # This work cannot be load-balanced; please ensure the main process is restarted
  # after setting this option in the shared configuration!

  # This style of configuration supersedes the legacy `synapse.app.appservice`
  # worker application type.


# pusher worker (no API endpoints) [
  # Handles sending push notifications to sygnal and email. Doesn't handle any
  # REST endpoints itself, but you should set `start_pushers: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse sending push notifications.

  # To run multiple instances at once the `pusher_instances` option should list all
  # pusher instances by their worker name, e.g.:

  # ```yaml
  # pusher_instances:
  #     - pusher_worker1
  #     - pusher_worker2
  # ```

  # An example for a pusher instance:

  # ```yaml
  # {{#include systemd-with-workers/workers/pusher_worker.yaml}}
  # ```

# ]

# appservice worker (no API endpoints) [
  # **Deprecated as of Synapse v1.59.** [Use `synapse.app.generic_worker` with the
  # `notify_appservices_from_worker` option instead.](#notifying-application-services)

  # Handles sending output traffic to Application Services. Doesn't handle any
  # REST endpoints itself, but you should set `notify_appservices: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse sending appservice notifications.

  # Note this worker cannot be load-balanced: only one instance should be active.

# ]

# federation_sender worker (no API endpoints) [
  # Handles sending federation traffic to other servers. Doesn't handle any
  # REST endpoints itself, but you should set `send_federation: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse sending this traffic.

  # If running multiple federation senders then you must list each
  # instance in the `federation_sender_instances` option by their `worker_name`.
  # All instances must be stopped and started when adding or removing instances.
  # For example:

  # ```yaml
  # federation_sender_instances:
  #     - federation_sender1
  #     - federation_sender2
  # ```

  # An example for a federation sender instance:

  # ```yaml
  # {{#include systemd-with-workers/workers/federation_sender.yaml}}
  # ```
# ]

matrix_synapse_workers_media_repository_endpoints:
  # Handles the media repository. It can handle all endpoints starting with:

  - ^/_matrix/media/

  # ... and the following regular expressions matching media-specific administration APIs:

  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/purge_media_cache$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/room/.*/media.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/user/.*/media.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/media/.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/quarantine_media/.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/users/.*/media$

  # You should also set `enable_media_repo: False` in the shared configuration
  # file to stop the main synapse running background jobs related to managing the
  # media repository. Note that doing so will prevent the main process from being
  # able to handle the above endpoints.

  # In the `media_repository` worker configuration file, configure the
  # [HTTP listener](usage/configuration/config_documentation.md#listeners) to
  # expose the `media` resource. For example:

  # ```yaml
  # {{#include systemd-with-workers/workers/media_worker.yaml}}
  # ```

  # Note that if running multiple media repositories they must be on the same server
  # and you must configure a single instance to run the background tasks, e.g.:

  # ```yaml
  # media_instance_running_background_jobs: "media-repository-1"
  # ```

  # Note that if a reverse proxy is used , then `/_matrix/media/` must be routed for both inbound client and federation requests (if they are handled separately).

matrix_synapse_workers_user_dir_endpoints:
  # **Deprecated as of Synapse v1.59.** [Use `synapse.app.generic_worker` with the
  # `update_user_directory_from_worker` option instead.](#updating-the-user-directory)

  # Handles searches in the user directory. It can handle REST endpoints matching
  # the following regular expressions:

  - ^/_matrix/client/(r0|v3|unstable)/user_directory/search$

  # When using this worker you must also set `update_user_directory: false` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse running background
  # jobs related to updating the user directory.

  # Above endpoint is not *required* to be routed to this worker. By default,
  # `update_user_directory` is set to `true`, which means the main process
  # will handle updates. All workers configured with `client` can handle the above
  # endpoint as long as either this worker or the main process are configured to
  # handle it, and are online.

  # If `update_user_directory` is set to `false`, and this worker is not running,
  # the above endpoint may give outdated results.
